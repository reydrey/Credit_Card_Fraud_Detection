# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
Two attempts to use a Credit Card fraud detection dataset of around 6million records to detect and predict fraud using autoencoders and supervised/unsupervised/semisupervised machine learning methods and comparing the outcomes of all the models to decide which one works best. This is currently a work in progress.
